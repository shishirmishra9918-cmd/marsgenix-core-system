# 🚀 MarsGenix – Hyperlocal Human-Help Platform (Core System)

MarsGenix is a **production-ready, MERN stack–based hyperlocal human-help platform** designed to connect customers with verified helpers for task-based local services, managed through a powerful admin control system. This repository contains the **entire core system** that serves as a scalable foundation for future mobile applications and platform expansion.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of MarsGenix is to build a **robust, secure, and scalable core platform** where customers can easily request help, helpers can accept and complete tasks to earn, and admins can fully monitor, verify, and control the ecosystem with real-time insights and pricing management.

---

## 🧩 System Overview

The platform is divided into three major roles:

* **Customer** – Requests tasks, tracks progress, and manages orders
* **Helper** – Accepts tasks, updates statuses, and tracks earnings
* **Admin** – Verifies helpers, manages users, controls pricing, and monitors analytics

MarsGenix follows a **modular MERN-based architecture** with clean separation between frontend, backend, and database layers.
